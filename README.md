PhongLightingWebGL
==================
This is a project I made for EECS 351 at Northwestern. It is a 3D scene containing some 3D shapes that have been lit by multiple Phong light sources. It uses fragment shading to create realistic lighting. The user can navigate the scene and view the objects from anywhere inside the WebGL canvas.
